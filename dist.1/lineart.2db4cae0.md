I downloaded a live wallpaper for my phone and it had this really cool particle effect where they would draw lines between the particles if they were close enough. I wanted to see if I could replicate this in a canvas and I totally did!

I added the ability for the particles to gravitate towards each other if they got close enough to draw a line between them.

And finally I added the options to control the background colour, the dot colour, the line colour, the dot size, and the gravity on the fly. Redux comes in really handy here!
