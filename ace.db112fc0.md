Our company hosted another "innovation day" which is essentially a 24 hour window to create/develop anything you like.

We replaced the printer head with a Dremmel and wrote custom software to convert a HTML canvas into G-Code instuctions for the 3D printer.

It was a hilarious project and if you want to see some results of our efforts you can [read about it in my blog post](https://jamesformica.github.io/blog/?article=7).
