So I decided to start making CSS YouTube videos, who could have seen this coming?

I wanted to share how _easy_ it is to create things with CSS and decided that recording myself was a good way to achieve it. Its been super fun and the videos are really easy to make.

So far I've created things like:
- Pok√©ball
- Chicken
- Trampoline
- Solar system
- Beer bottle
