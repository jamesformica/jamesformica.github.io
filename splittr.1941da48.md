Splittr is built on top of my other creation SimplePaint. The idea of this project revolves around
[compound words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_(linguistics)). A compound word is a word made up of other words such as pancake (pan - cake).

Using my SimplePaint library, both parts of the compound word are drawn on a canvas and saved. The lovely drawings are then presented to the final player who must guess the compound word based off the two images alone.

Pretty simple. Pretty fun!
