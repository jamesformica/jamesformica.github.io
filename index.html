						Splittr is built on top of my other creation SimplePaint. The idea of this project revolves around <a href="#">compound words</a>.
						A compound word is a word made up of other words such as pancake (pan - cake).
						<br/>
						<br/> Using my <a href="#simplepaint">SimplePaint</a> library, both parts of the compound word are drawn on a canvas
						and saved. The lovely drawings are then presented to the final player who must guess the compound word based off the
						two images alone.
						<br/>
						<br/> Pretty simple. Pretty fun!

						Imagine MS Paint on an Html Canvas but only with the most basic but awesome features... May i present SimplePaint. It's a
						tiny library that constructs a canvas and allows you to draw whatever your heart desires.
						<br/>
						<br/> Using EaselJS under the hood to draw lines and ensure mobile compatibility it boosts amazing features such as
						the Erase tool, Fill tool (with a mediocre attempt at antialiasing) and a gorgeous palette of colours.
						<br/>
						<br/> This one was honestly so much fun and even comes with a typescript definition file for the 0 people out there
						who will use this :P

						my cousin about web development with a fun and silly app.
						<br/>

						world of javascript to the dynamic world of Ruby. See if you can beat you friends!

						This one is my favourite, easily. I had so much fun building this learning tool for a tech talk about CSS. Each screen has
						an area to enter CSS and see the result next to it. And it gets very silly, very quick.
						<br/>
						<br/> There are four sections that start easy and get a bit harder to complete:
						<ol>
							<li>Basic Shapes</li>
							<li>"Real World" Examples</li>
							<li>Animations (using @keyframes)</li>
							<li>Derpy Examples (the best)</li>
						</ol>
						Seriously, have a play with this one.

						As my house was being built I wanted to create a place where I could upload photos as an event and track them as a timeline.
						<br/>
						<br/> The timeline UI was fun to work out and looks pretty good, but ultimately I never ended up using it. It's a bit
						of a shame really but the damn house was taking too long and the updates would have been pretty boring.
						<br/>
						<br/> Oh well, onto the next one.

						This project was essentially paper vs. web in that the current implementation of this in our house was a chalk board that
						we would plan our weekly dinner meals on. I wanted to bring this idea to 2015.
						<br/>
						<br/> Using the Food2Fork api you could search for recipes and add them to a day of the week. The search results are
						displayed in a manner similar to Pintrest's which is pretty neat. I event had a crack at Google OAuth login.
						<br/>
						<br/> I think the overall style and UI of this app is it's best feature. I really enjoyed working on this one but you
						can probably guess what happened... The chalk board won :(

						CHOO CHOO!!!! My second favourite project, ever! As a child, I obsessed over Lego Loco and always wanted a version I could
						play with online.
						<br/>
						<br/> What started out as one man's dream to turn an Html Canvas into a basic birdseye train simulator turned into
						an awesome team effort with my colleagues. There is so much to talk about with this project. From the amazing track
						joining logic to the hilarious train naming conventions and the spectaular 'lighting engine', this project became more
						than I ever thought was possible.
						<br/>
						<br/> Seriously, stop reading this and <a href="https://jamesformica.github.io/trains" target="_blank">GO PLAY THIS GAME</a>,
						you won't regret it!

						Oh boy... this one takes me back. The idea was simple: <i>Ask a question to your friends - receive annonymous
						answers from your friends.</i>
						<br/>
						<br/> It quickly became clear that maybe this app wasn't such a good idea and could get people in trouble so I stopped.
						<br/>
						<br/> I remember struggling with the UI and overall colour scheme with this project. It helped me learn what different
						styles were out there and which ones I personally liked. It's by no means my favourite project but it is an important
						one in terms of my development skills.
