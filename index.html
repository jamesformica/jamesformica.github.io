						Following the trend with L-Systems, the visual representation of biological plants really caught my intention. I wanted to
						build my own Lindenmayer system that could generate plants in an aquarium environment. Spoiler alert: It was super
						fun to build and the result is quite therapeutic to watch.
					</p>

					<p>
						The basic premise to any L-System is to have the following: an alphabet, an axiom, and some rules. The alphabet consisted
						of: <b>F + - [ ]</b>. The axiom was the starting character and the rules dictated string replacement operations.
						In the end you end up with a massive sentence of characters which when rendered produces beautiful art. There's a 'how
						it works' modal in the app that goes into specifics with examples.

						I downloaded a live wallpaper for my phone and it had this really cool particle effect where they would draw lines between
						the particles if they were close enough. I wanted to see if I could replicate this in a canvas and I totally did!
						<br />
						<br /> I added the ability for the particles to gravitate towards each other if they got close enough to draw a line
						between them.
						<br />
						<br /> And finally I added the options to control the background colour, the dot colour, the line colour, the dot size,
						and the gravity on the fly. Redux comes in really handy here!

						Continuing on from my 'canvas with interaction' projects I came up with this crazy idea for the upcoming hack day at work.
						<br />
						<br /> The idea: a draw-your-own-adventure using a canvas and a story engine surrounding it.
						<br />
						<br /> Well, we didn't win any awards, but the app turned out to be really really cool. We ended up utilising an API
						from the Google Quickdraw game which analysed the drawings on the canvas and guessed what it was.
						<br /> The story we built around it was basically a JSON file which had 'chapters' that linked to each other based
						on different trigger words. This is a seriously fun app that I'm quite proud of.

						I was sitting at my desk one day when this idea üí° popped into my head. What if I utilised Azure's cognitive services to
						analyse what someone was saying, then start painting on the canvas based on the sentiment of what they had said.
						<br />
						<br /> And that's exactly what I did. The app listens to what you are saying, converts the speech into text, then analyses
						the text for the sentiment then starts painting. It turned out to be much cooler than I thought so please stop reading
						this and go play with it.

						<br/> Using the Food2Fork api you could search for recipes and add them to a day of the week. The search results are
						displayed in a manner similar to Pintrest's which is pretty neat. I event had a crack at Google OAuth login.
						<br/>
						<br/> I think the overall style and UI of this app is it's best feature. I really enjoyed working on this one but you
						can probably guess what happened... The chalk board won :(

						CHOO CHOO!!!! My second favourite project, ever! As a child, I obsessed over Lego Loco and always wanted a version I could
						play with online.
						<br/>
						<br/> What started out as one man's dream to turn an Html Canvas into a basic birdseye train simulator turned into
						an awesome team effort with my colleagues. There is so much to talk about with this project. From the amazing track
						joining logic to the hilarious train naming conventions and the spectaular 'lighting engine', this project became more
						than I ever thought was possible.
						<br/>
						<br/> Seriously, stop reading this and
						<a href="https://jamesformica.github.io/trains" target="_blank">GO PLAY THIS GAME</a>, you won't regret it!

						Oh boy... this one takes me back. The idea was simple:
						<i>Ask a question to your friends - receive annonymous answers from your friends.</i>
						<br/>
						<br/> It quickly became clear that maybe this app wasn't such a good idea and could get people in trouble so I stopped.
						<br/>
						<br/> I remember struggling with the UI and overall colour scheme with this project. It helped me learn what different
						styles were out there and which ones I personally liked. It's by no means my favourite project but it is an important
						one in terms of my development skills.
