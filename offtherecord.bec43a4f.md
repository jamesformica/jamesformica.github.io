Oh boy... this one takes me back. The idea was simple: *Ask a question to your friends - receive annonymous answers from your friends.*

It quickly became clear that maybe this app wasn't such a good idea and could get people in trouble so I stopped.

I remember struggling with the UI and overall colour scheme with this project. It helped me learn what different styles were out there and which ones I personally liked. It's by no means my favourite project but it is an important one in terms of my development skills.
