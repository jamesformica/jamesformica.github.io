A great talk at Web Directions CODE 2018 in Melbourne was about programming generative art revolving around L-systems and such.

I then spent the next 30 minutes of the afternoon tea break creating this random generative canvas app. It is absolutely crazy and isn't a proper L-system but it is super fun to watch and I love the colours!
