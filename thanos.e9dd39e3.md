When driving the car a few weeks back, I made a joke to my finac√© that she should learn to code by creating a website that told you if you survived Thanos' finger snap. She didn't care much for it, but I wanted to make it anyway.

I used this app as an excuse to play with [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html), and they are a game changer. It was such a fun experience to play with them. I ended up using almost all of them:
`useState`, `useContext`, `useReducer`, `useEffect`, `useRef`.

I then built the '_dust_' animation for the screen on which you die using a quick canvas render.

Super fun project and I'll be wanting to use more of hooks now.
