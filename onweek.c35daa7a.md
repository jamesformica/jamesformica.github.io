REA Group has one of the best Grad programs in Australia, so when the opportunity presented itself to build a website to assist the program, I was very quick to say yes. On boarding is a giant process for the new grads and consists of over 2 weeks of training, presentations, and even building real applications. It can be certainly overwhelming!

So I built a website with their entire schedule so they would always know where they needed to be and what was coming next. But this is me we are talking about, I can't just build a normal website. So I sprinkled a bit of _'James'_ over the site and built a canvas drawing competition, because why not? I also dropped quite a few easter eggs into the site which do the following:

* Completely flip the entire site around
* Spin some heads
* Quote a confused fictional character
* Make a rocketship fly
* Offer to buy a chocolate bar

It was super fun to build and I'm actually really happy with how the design of it all turned out considering I smashed out pretty much the entire thing in a couple afternoons.
