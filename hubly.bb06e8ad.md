Another year, another REA.io hack day project, although this time I decided to actually work on something useful! The theme for the event was **MUDA** which translates roughly to **waste** I believe.

The world of coworking collided with the world of waste, and the output was Hubly. Our goal was to show people how much Co2 and time they waste commuting all the way into the REA office instead of utilising a coworking space near their home. This is how it worked:

1. Enter in your address (Google maps autocomplete assisted)
2. Enter your mode of transport (Car, Train, Bike, etc...)
3. We geolocate your address and pick the closes coworking space
4. We calculate the journey from home to work
5. We calculate the journey from home to the coworking space
6. Present a fun infographic on the comparison

It turned out really great and most importantly did a great job of representing how much carbon dioxide is produced by comparing it to how many Silkie Chickens üêì have the same weight.
