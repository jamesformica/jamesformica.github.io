As my house was being built I wanted to create a place where I could upload photos as an event and track them as a timeline.

The timeline UI was fun to work out and looks pretty good, but ultimately I never ended up using it. It's a bit of a shame really but the damn house was taking too long and the updates would have been pretty boring.

Oh well, onto the next one.
