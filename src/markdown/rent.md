The theme for this work Hack Day: **Rent**! So there I sat, thinking to myself "what crazy web app can I build related to rent??" And then it dawned on me, I would create a 'vent about rent' diary app. And that's just what I did.

The idea is simple, I have a bunch of pre-defined diary entries, and a bunch of pre-defined emotions. The diary entries need an emotion to complete them, so where does the emotion come from? Well, the user's facial expression of course! This crazy app uses your facial expression to guess your emotion and complete a diary entry of a few sentences. Completely wild, completely hilarious!

*NOTE: I was the first project to get disqualified for not using the internal UI component library to build it* ðŸ˜­
