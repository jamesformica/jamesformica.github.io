(🦒 + 🐐) + 🖼 + 🕹

I've been meaning to make a Llama game for a while now and this is my second attempt. I've always liked the idea of a game with a single control. Side-scroller games lend themselves really nicely to this idea!

I decided how all the collision was going to work and set about creating the game out of coloured squares. To bring it to life I got out my old watercolour painting set and went to town. 👨🏻‍🎨
