Imagine MS Paint on an Html Canvas but only with the most basic but awesome features... May i present SimplePaint. It's a tiny library that constructs a canvas and allows you to draw whatever your heart desires.

Using EaselJS under the hood to draw lines and ensure mobile compatibility it boosts amazing features such as the Erase tool, Fill tool (with a mediocre attempt at antialiasing) and a gorgeous palette of colours.

This one was honestly so much fun and even comes with a typescript definition file for the 0 people out there who will use this ðŸ˜œ
