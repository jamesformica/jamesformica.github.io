Rock, Paper, Scissors (or whatever order you say it in) online tournament. This project came about as an attempt to teach my cousin about web development with a fun and silly app.

It's a bit buggy but it was a great opportunity to help my cousin see what development is like, from the crazy world of javascript to the dynamic world of Ruby. See if you can beat you friends!
