CHOO CHOO!!!! My second favourite project, ever! As a child, I obsessed over Lego Loco and always wanted a version I could play with online.

What started out as one man's dream to turn an Html Canvas into a basic birdseye train simulator turned into an awesome team effort with my colleagues. There is so much to talk about with this project. From the amazing track joining logic to the hilarious train naming conventions and the spectaular 'lighting engine', this project became more than I ever thought was possible.

Seriously, stop reading this and [GO PLAY THIS GAME](https://jamesformica.github.io/trains), you won't regret it!
