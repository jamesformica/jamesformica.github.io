My first (non work related) project of 2019!

I hopped on the train in the morning and decided I was going to build this thing that I had kind of seen before but didn't really know much about or what it was used for. All I knew is that it was a bunch of connected circles where a line followed the outermost one. Turns out they are called _Fourier circles_ or something similar.

I built this entire thing in a day's commute so the code is a solid D+ in quality.

It was fun and I'm considering doing a talk on building mini canvas apps.
