I was sitting at my desk one day when this idea ðŸ’¡ popped into my head. What if I utilised Azure's cognitive services to analyse what someone was saying, then start painting on the canvas based on the sentiment of what they had said.

And that's exactly what I did. The app listens to what you are saying, converts the speech into text, then analyses the text for the sentiment then starts painting. It turned out to be much cooler than I thought so please stop reading this and go play with it.
