I've been working on a lot of silly project recently, and whilst they are fun, I missed creating something that solved an actual problem for someone.

Becomming a delivery lead has recently become my career path of choice. However, I was warned that I would still need to find a creative outlet, so I decided to create a web application that replicated the work of my current delivery lead.

This app keeps track of each sprint, the calendar of the team members, the retro sentiment and cards, and any other notes that seem important. It also syncs up with Jira to pull in data from it's sprint such as number of cards and what status they are in.

The backend was written in NodeJs with a GraphQL endpoint and a MongoDB database in the background. All of this was pretty new to me but super fun to play around with!
