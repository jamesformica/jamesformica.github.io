This one is one of my favourites, easily. I had so much fun building this learning tool for a tech talk about CSS. Each screen has an area to enter CSS and see the result next to it. And it gets very silly, very quick.

There are four sections that start easy and get a bit harder to complete:

- Basic Shapes
- "Real World" Examples
- Animations (using @keyframes)
- Derpy Examples (the best)

Plus it has a cat, turtle and flamingo drawn in CSS, what more do you want???
