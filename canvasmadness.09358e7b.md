Canvas has always been an important and fun part of my development careers. It's not really an area that you get to play with at work. I wanted to put together an interactive presentation that goes promotes canvas and showcases the things that can be done when you let your creativity flow.

I initially talk about *why* people struggle to develop canvas apps, then move on to demoing some of my own creations. Overally I am really happy with this presentation and can't wait to deliver it to the community!
