This project was essentially paper vs. web in that the current implementation of this in our house was a chalk board that we would plan our weekly dinner meals on. I wanted to bring this idea to 2015.

Using the Food2Fork api you could search for recipes and add them to a day of the week. The search results are displayed in a manner similar to Pintrest's which is pretty neat. I event had a crack at Google OAuth login.

I think the overall style and UI of this app is it's best feature. I really enjoyed working on this one but you can probably guess what happened... The chalk board won :(
