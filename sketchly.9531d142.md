Continuing on from my 'canvas with interaction' projects I came up with this crazy idea for the upcoming hack day at work.

**The idea:** a draw-your-own-adventure using a canvas and a story engine surrounding it.

Well, we didn't win any awards, but the app turned out to be really really cool. We ended up utilising an API from the Google Quickdraw game which analysed the drawings on the canvas and guessed what it was.

The story we built around it was basically a JSON file which had 'chapters' that linked to each other based on different trigger words. This is a seriously fun app that I'm quite proud of.
